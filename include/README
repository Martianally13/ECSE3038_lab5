Lab 4 was intended to show the how PUT requests work between an ESP32 and an api which was provided. Arduino code (C++) was to accomplish this on an ESP32.

For some reason the files in the gitignore....and the gitignore was uploaded onto git hub which is a head scratcher but a solution will be found to this conundrum. 

The API tester site which was originally made to control the lighting of 3 leds connected to ports on the ESP32 was used in reverse such that a predetermined sequence of lighting (of the leds) was reflected on the API. This displayed the connection between the HTTP requests, the API, (and possibly a server) and an embedded system with WIFI capabilities.
